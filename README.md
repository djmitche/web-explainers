Borrowed from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/main/README.md:

[Explainers](https://w3ctag.github.io/explainers) are documents focused on 
describing a user/ developer/ customer problem (at a high level) and exploring 
potential solutions. These documents are starting points for engaging in discussion 
with you and other members of the community. Explainers should address their 
stated problems in clear and easy to understand language. Proposed solutions
should be easy to follow and not too deep in technical details. When you read
an explainer, we hope the stated problem is compelling and you can form an 
opinion for whether the proposed solution would address the problem.
